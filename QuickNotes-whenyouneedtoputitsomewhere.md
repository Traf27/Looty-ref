1. Option in settings, or smth to decide where to position tooltip
  - can be some further way from cursor
  - also i could slim design a little and make it opaque

2. When turning on unparsed column i could turn off text-overflow ellipsis just for this column - so long text was all visible

3. while having cursor on column header, whole column could be highligted in higlht column color
  - add to column cells new class ex. col-highlighted

#### 4. check every prefix in ComputedItemProps if it parsed poprawnie, jak nie to wyłącz lub napraw

5. move further away Tooltip window - maybe even make it stationary

6. for some mod fields think about helper text
  - good idea is to make maybe custom modal window/tooltip ?
