## Looty-ref

Library of ideas for my endavours, tinkering with [Looty](https://github.com/benjaminjackman/looty/) stash manager
to have all in one place remotely avaiable

[GitKraken board](https://app.gitkraken.com/glo/board/XdYli-AbPwAPFRzD)

#### TODO
mostly the same as in glo boards, thus its easier sometimes for me to add here, and update there :)

Planned improvements:
 Design:
 - [ ] move menu
 - [ ] create help menu/panel
  
  
  
 Code:
 - [ ] resolve Throtteling errors, using limit headers values
 - [ ] add chaos equivalent price to your owned currency with [poe.ninja data](https://poe.ninja/api/Data/GetCurrencyOverview?league=Blight)
 - [ ] add jewel types for search/filter like: 
  ```
  { 
    "jewelTypes":[
    "Searching Eye Abyss Jewel",
    "Murdering Eye Abyss Jewel",
    " ... Eye Abyss Jewel",
    "Crimson Jewel",
    "Viridian Jewel",
    "Cobalt Jewel"
    ]
  }
  ```
  
  Both: 
 - [ ] experiment with icons for every row/ or for row with Jewels
